First the files "X_train","X_test" are read into tables X_train and X_test.
Then these files are binded together.
Then the features are read into a table called features.
Those features that include "mean" or "std" are identified.
The indices of the mean or std features are used to extract the related data from the binded data.
The names of the features are edited.

In the next part, the activity labels are read into a table. Those labels in y_train and y_test are also imported.
The same processes are done for the subjects.
The subjects from y_train and y_test are binded into y.
Then it is named "activity".
In the "subject_activity_mean_std" the subject, activity labels and the related data are binded together.

In the final step the standard deviation and mean of the data based on the subject and activity is computed.
