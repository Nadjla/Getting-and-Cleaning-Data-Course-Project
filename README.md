In this assignment the task is to merge two data sets "test" and "train".
In this document, the input data is explained.
The UCI HAR Dataset folder, has to folders "test" and "train". Beside them, them there are many txt files, providing the activity labels, the feature names, and README that explains all the input data in details.
In each folder of "test" or "train" there are a folder "Inertial Signal" that is not addressed in this assignment. The rest includes three "txt" files. The file "subject_(test/train)" identifies the individuals who did the test. There were 30 subjects that did the tests.
The subjects are numbered from 1 to 30. The data in "X_(test/train)" are the data related to the subjects. Each rows of data in the file "X_(test/train)" is related to an activity that is labeled in the file "y_test".
